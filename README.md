# Attention Task Image Generator

This repository contains a Python script, which creates Full-HD images of an attention task (similar to [d2 attention task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D2_Test_of_Attention)). I used the tool for empirical research on program comprehension (see [study repository](https://github.com/brains-on-code/simultaneous-fmri-and-eyetracking)).
This means the script is personalized to my specific usage and probably not directly useful to you without changes. Moreover, some of the text is in German as we conduct studies with German participants.

**Disclaimer: I am not a Python programmer. I'm always grateful for feedback on how to improve my code.**

## Further Features

I added a couple of more functions to generate images. They create images for some additional conditions for my studies: rest condition, grace period for last decision, eye-tracking calibration check.

## Font

The text is generated with the Inconsolata font. The font licence is here: [Inconsolata licence](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/license/Inconsolata).

## Setup ##

The project should run in any Python environment. It was developed and tested with the [PyCharms IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
